			<p>
				At Made Worthy Media, my mission is to capture the full story of your day. From the big,
				unforgettable moments to the quiet, in-between ones that often mean the most. I believe
				there's beauty in the unposed and power in the unplanned, and I'm here to preserve it all
				with intention and heart.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love creating heartfelt, candid content that helps people relive not just how their day
				looked, but how it felt. My vision is to celebrate the real, raw, joy-filled moments, both
				grand and subtle, that make your story uniquely yours.
