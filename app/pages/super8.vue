			<p>
				Super 8 is my absolute favorite way to document someone's wedding day.. I oftentimes say
				that The magic of Super 8 lies in how it makes you feel. Unlike traditional wedding videos,
				it doesn't just replay your day, but draws you back into it. It's less about watching a film
				and more about stepping into the memory itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Super 8 is a style of video making that uses 8mm Kodak film. these are perfect for the
				couples who want a wedding video that carries the intimacy of a home video, wrapped in the
				texture and grace of a cinematic film.
			</p>
			<p>
				All packages can be customized to your day and what your needs are. But this will give us a
				great starting point so that we can build a package that meets those needs.
