					Super 8 is my absolute favorite way to document someone's wedding day.. I oftentimes say
					that The magic of Super 8 lies in how it makes you feel. Unlike traditional wedding
					videos, it doesn't just replay your day, but draws you back into it. It's less about
					watching a film and more about stepping into the memory itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Super 8 is a style of video making that uses 8mm Kodak film. these are perfect for the
					couples who want a wedding video that carries the intimacy of a home video, wrapped in the
					texture and grace of a cinematic film.
				</p>
				<p>
					All packages can be customized to your day and what your needs are. But this will give us
					a great starting point so that we can build a package that meets those needs.
